## Misc

**Branch**
-   There should be a new branch created for every sub part i.e. a branch for 1a)
    and another branch for 1b) etc. Need nice branch names pls
- Do NOT delete branches when merging (Untick the box)

**Merge Requests**
-   For the convience of code checking/reviewing, merge requests should contain code
    for only one subpart i.e. only 1a) or only 1b). It shouldn't contain both. (unless specified on spec)
-   Code will only be merged to master after it is reviewed by another person
-   Don't forget to include merge requests link to the appropriate section in your blog!
    (Both pair and individual blog) + follow any additional Instructions on the spec

Also as a side note: always constantly git pull origin  master to be on top of the changes.

**Code Reviewing**
-   Reviewing code consists of checking line by line, to make sure there is no bugs
    or any numerical/typo error if there is. The tests MUST be checked so that it covers
    every edge case. All of the exhaustive edge cases should be documented here in this
    file if possible. i.e. a brief dot point describing what the test emulates
