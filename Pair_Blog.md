## Task 1) Code Analysis and Refactoring ‚õèÔ∏è

### a) From DRY to Design Patterns

[Links to your merge requests](https://nw-syd-gitlab.cseunsw.tech/COMP2511/24T1/teams/M11B_JUKEBOX/assignment-ii/-/merge_requests/5)

> i. Look inside src/main/java/dungeonmania/entities/enemies. Where can you notice an instance of repeated code? Note down the particular offending lines/methods/fields.

[Answer]
In both Mercenary.java and ZombieToast.java, there was a series of repetitive if statements
in the "move" method, in particular onwards from the check of the InvincibilityPotion.

> ii. What Design Pattern could be used to improve the quality of the code and avoid repetition? Justify your choice by relating the scenario to the key characteristics of your chosen Design Pattern.

[Answer]
Currently, much of this logic is irrelevant and can be abstracted away. As such, 
we can use a Strategy pattern that delegrates this responsibility/logic into another
file to simplify things, thereby removing the repeated code. This design pattern
allows flexibility as we utilise composition by encapsulating an interface, so for whatever
reason we need to change how the enemy moves, it can be done so without modifying the actual
enemy files.

> iii. Using your chosen Design Pattern, refactor the code to remove the repetition.

[Briefly explain what you did]
I created the EnemyMovement interface which only had an "apply" method which would
be responsible for changing the movement of the enemy when called. Next, MoveSpider,
MoveZombieToast, and MoveMercenary was created to contain the logic that we would 
like to abstract away from the offending files. 
Since we're using a new instance variable through composition, we're required to 
intialise this variable in the constructutor with the help of getters and setters. 
And also, any required getters and setters for this refactoring was made.


### b) Observer Pattern

> Identify one place where the Observer Pattern is present in the codebase, and outline how the implementation relates to the key characteristics of the Observer Pattern.

[Answer]

### c) Inheritance Design

> i. Name the code smell present in the above code. Identify all subclasses of Entity which have similar code smells that point towards the same root cause.

[Answer]

> ii. Redesign the inheritance structure to solve the problem, in doing so remove the smells.

[Briefly explain what you did]

### d) More Code Smells

> i. What design smell is present in the above description?

[Answer]

> ii. Refactor the code to resolve the smell and underlying problem causing it.

[Briefly explain what you did]

### e) Open-Closed Goals

[Links to your merge requests](/put/links/here)

> i. Do you think the design is of good quality here? Do you think it complies with the open-closed principle? Do you think the design should be changed?

[Answer]

> ii. If you think the design is sufficient as it is, justify your decision. If you think the answer is no, pick a suitable Design Pattern that would improve the quality of the code and refactor the code accordingly.
