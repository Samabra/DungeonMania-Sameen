## Task 1) Code Analysis and Refactoring ‚õèÔ∏è

### a) From DRY to Design Patterns

[Links to your merge requests](https://nw-syd-gitlab.cseunsw.tech/COMP2511/24T1/teams/M11B_JUKEBOX/assignment-ii/-/merge_requests/5)

> i. Look inside src/main/java/dungeonmania/entities/enemies. Where can you notice an instance of repeated code? Note down the particular offending lines/methods/fields.

[Answer]
In both Mercenary.java and ZombieToast.java, there was a series of repetitive if statements
in the "move" method, in particular onwards from the check of the InvincibilityPotion.

> ii. What Design Pattern could be used to improve the quality of the code and avoid repetition? Justify your choice by relating the scenario to the key characteristics of your chosen Design Pattern.

[Answer]
Currently, much of this logic is irrelevant and can be abstracted away. As such, 
we can use a Strategy pattern that delegrates this responsibility/logic into another
file to simplify things, thereby removing the repeated code. This design pattern
allows flexibility as we utilise composition by encapsulating an interface, so for whatever
reason we need to change how the enemy moves, it can be done so without modifying the actual
enemy files.

> iii. Using your chosen Design Pattern, refactor the code to remove the repetition.

[Briefly explain what you did]
I created the EnemyMovement interface which only had an "apply" method which would
be responsible for changing the movement of the enemy when called. Next, MoveSpider,
MoveZombieToast, and MoveMercenary was created to contain the logic that we would 
like to abstract away from the offending files. 
Since we're using a new instance variable through composition, we're required to 
intialise this variable in the constructutor with the help of getters and setters. 
And also, any required getters and setters for this refactoring was made.


### b) Observer Pattern

> Identify one place where the Observer Pattern is present in the codebase, and outline how the implementation relates to the key characteristics of the Observer Pattern.

[Answer]
The observer pattern is present in the public class Switch, which extends an abstract class called Entity. In this relationship, the bombs are the observers and the Switch is the subject. The Switch class contains
a private list of Bomb instances called "bombs", consistent with the characteristics of the Observer Pattern since the Subject contains a list of its observers. This is indicated by several other factors, which are all characteristics of an Observer Pattern.

In the Observer Pattern the Observer should be able to subscribe/unsubscribe from the Subject. Yet, a Switch cannot unsubscribe from a Bomb, which ascertains the fact that Switch is our Subject and Bomb is our observer even though both have a subscribe method. Additionally, Switch has an unsubscribe method  which allows for dynamic subscription/unsubscription of a Bomb from a Switch.

Furthermore, the Bomb cannot notify or update the Switch, as these methods do not exist in Switch. However, a notify method is implemented 
in Bomb, and Switch can call this method to notify a Bomb in a Switch's list of bombs when it is activated, in which a Bomb is notified, thereby changing the state of the Bomb (Bomb explodes).


The relationship is a many-to-many relationship, but has a one-to-many dependency on Switch. A Bomb can subscribe to many Switch's and a Switch can subscribe to many Bomb's. Nonetheless, a one-to-many dependency does exist, and that is on Switch.
Only Switch has the capacity to notify or update the state of many Bomb's. A Bomb cannot reciprocate this action. Hence there is 
still a one-to-many relationship, in the sense that there is a one-to-many dependency.

Thus the relationship between Switch and Bomb is indicative of an Observer Pattern in this code base.

### c) Inheritance Design

> i. Name the code smell present in the above code. Identify all subclasses of Entity which have similar code smells that point towards the same root cause.

[Answer]
Since the onOverLap, onMovedAway and onDestroy methods are defined to be 
functionally redundant, it is a refused bequest! (violates Liskov Substitution Principle)
Subclasses with this code smell includes:
-   Boulder.java
-   Door.java
-   Exit.java
-   Player.java
-   Portal.java
-   Switch.java
-   Wall.java
-   Arrow.java
-   Bomb.java
-   Key.java
-   Sword.java
-   Treasure.java
-   Wood.java
-   ZombieToastSpawner.java
-   Builder.java (abstract superclass of Bow and Shield)
-   Potion.java (abstract superclass of InvincibilityPotion and InvisibilityPotion)
-   Enemy.java (abstract superclass of Mercenary, Spider, ZombieToast)


> ii. Redesign the inheritance structure to solve the problem, in doing so remove the smells.

[Briefly explain what you did]
Since:
Only Enemy and ZombieToastSpawner implemented onDestroy.
Only Switch implemented OnMovedAway.
Only Boulder, Door, Player, Portal, Switch, Arrow, Bomb, Key, Sword, Treasure, Wood, 
Potion and Enemy implemented OnOverlap.
I decided that it would be better off to create separate interfaces as a marker 
that these methods exist in the entity object. Alternatively, the classic approach
would be to delegate these methods elsewhere, but this would ruin the ability to 
store the entities all in one list or cause other type incompatibilities. Anyhow, 
I removed all of the redundant methods and allowed the classes that implemented the
methods to implement the respective interfaces. Then to also fix type incompabilities
when looping through the entire entity list in GameMap, I had to typecast to the 
correct interface.
Also additionally changed the hardcoded return canMoveOnto method in Entity.java 
to true and removed all instances of the overrides that hardcoded returned true in
its subclasses and added hardcoded returns to false to respective files.

### d) More Code Smells

> i. What design smell is present in the above description?

[Answer]

> ii. Refactor the code to resolve the smell and underlying problem causing it.

[Briefly explain what you did]

### e) Open-Closed Goals

[Links to your merge requests](/put/links/here)

> i. Do you think the design is of good quality here? Do you think it complies with the open-closed principle? Do you think the design should be changed?
Looking at GoalFactory.java first, this is a factory method, so the usage of switch
statements are unavoidable (there is nothing wrong with it!). However, looking 
at Goal.java, both the "achieved" and "toString" methods uses large switch statements 
which is a code smell. This does not comply with the open-closed principle since

[Answer]

> ii. If you think the design is sufficient as it is, justify your decision. If you think the answer is no, pick a suitable Design Pattern that would improve the quality of the code and refactor the code accordingly.
